                At the initiative of the Youth Resource Center, 13 volunteer groups with a total of 422 members were established in the district.
                Throughout the year, these volunteer groups provide assistance to socially vulnerable segments of the population.
                Additionally, ongoing campaigns are conducted in rural areas, such as “Dream Tree” (Арман ағашы), “Birgemiz Saulyq,” “Safe District,” “Warmth of the Soul,” “Beskarai – Clean Zone,” the relay “Let’s Compete in Kindness,” and charity actions like “A Thousand Thanks,” “BizBirgemiz,” “Kind Soul,” and “Give Warmth.” 
                As part of these charitable initiatives, assistance was provided to 395 families.

                It is encouraging that our youth willingly take care of the older generation. Each year, during the campaign “Respect for Veterans” (Ардагерлерді ардақтайық), district volunteer groups help elderly people living alone, home front workers, and people with disabilities by cleaning up yards, removing snow and trash, and preparing firewood.

                During the pandemic, volunteer groups provided vital support by delivering handmade face masks, informational brochures, special newspaper editions, as well as food and medicine to vulnerable populations through a courier service.
